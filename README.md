# iOS4Android_iLauncher
Fork of  itsJoKr's iOS4Android. https://github.com/itsJoKr/iOS4Android
All I did was update everything to be null-saftey compliant and dumped all the flutter/dart componenets into a new flutter project to avoid dealing with an old gradle.

## Requirements
- Dart: https://dart.dev/get-dart
- Flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
- An IDE that supports flutter (Android Studio has flutter and dart plugins, you just need to add the sdk directory to where each of them are in settings)

## Help
This is highly likely to be orphaned.
Given the smoothness of the demo app, this could be made into a real launcher to rival the fidelity of suckamoni's iLauncher.
Oh, and I'm not a programmer NOOO and know even less when it comes to android development and github. So, update intervals to this repo will be turbulent at the very best.
